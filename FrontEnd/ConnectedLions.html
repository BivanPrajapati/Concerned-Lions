                    <h1>Career history</h1>
                    <p id="carrer-overview">Roger Federer’s career was a masterclass in elegance, longevity, and dominance. Bursting onto the scene with his first Grand Slam win at Wimbledon in 2003, he went on to win 20 major titles, spend a record 310 weeks as World No. 1, and redefine the sport with his fluid style, precision, and grace. After an era of unmatched dominance in the mid-2000s, he adapted his game to face new rivals like Nadal and Djokovic, enjoying a remarkable resurgence in his mid-30s. Even through injury setbacks and a late-career decline, Federer remained a beloved icon and global ambassador for tennis. He retired in 2022, leaving behind a legacy as one of the greatest and most admired athletes in sports history.</p>
